There are beings who walks among us that wish to use us as a life source. They take from us something that we don’t even realize is being taken. These beings could be your friends, teachers, colleagues, or even your partners. But fret not for we have found that they don’t begin there nefarious actions until after they get into a romantic relationship with you , something activates in there brain when they get into a romantic relationship. Now you may ask well what are they doing to us what are they taking from us? </p>
		<p>When we first discovered the existence of the Zorr all the way back in the 50’s in a small town located in [Redacted]we quickly moved to capture the subject so that we can know what their motives where. That is how we learned of their need for our human warmth and also the fact that they could take our souls through simply just making contact with them. We questioned the subject who’s human name was Mark Evers but we unfortunately couldn’t understand his name in the Zorriain’s language (a name we created to speak of a single member of the Zorr race ). </p>
