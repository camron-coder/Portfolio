	<p class="bio">Hello, my name is Camron Anderson and I'm a student at Columbia College Chicago. I'm into things like gaming, anime, and webcomics. Some of my hobbies include gardening, taking things apart, and cooking. My favorite season is the winter because I love how cold it gets and I like to shovel snow. My ultimate dream in life is to make and release a game that I'm proud of. But another one of my dreams is just get into any part of the game industry. Before I only thought of trying to become a programmer but now I think I want to go with the level design route or maybe even try my hand at the art side of it.</p>
