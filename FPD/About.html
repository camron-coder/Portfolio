<p id="founder">The founder of Warma is a mysterious figure that many in the organization don&#39;t know the identity of only refereed to as M.G.F . Nothing is really known about them they may even be more then one person who knows maybe you will one day find out .</p>
<p id="Location">Founded all the way back in 50&#39;s we started to operate as a shadow branch of the U.S. government but we also have branches established all around the world. Our goal is to fully understand and hopefully stop the beings known as the Zorr as they threaten to one day cause the extinction of the human race.</p>
